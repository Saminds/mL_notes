Session 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
Learning Problem Framework
A learning problem is defined by three components:
T (Task), P (Performance Measure), and E (Experience)
→ Learning Problem = (T, P, E)

Goal: Use experience to make better predictions on unseen data.

 Regression
A regression problem is when we predict a continuous value from input features.

Linear regression: fitting a straight line to the data.

Supervised Learning
In supervised learning, the model learns from labeled data to predict output 
𝑦
y from input 
𝑥
x.
